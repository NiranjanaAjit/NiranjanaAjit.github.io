                <li id="head">Normal</li>
                <p id="p1">This skin is neither too dry nor too oily. It has regular texture, no imperfections and a clean, soft appearance, and does not need special care.
                </p>
                <li id="head">Dry</li>
                <p id="p1">Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly. The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person. It's a common condition that affects people of all ages</p>
                <li id="head">Oily</li>
                <p id="p1">Oily skin has a porous, humid and bright appearance. It is caused by excessive fat production by sebaceous glands, and usually determined by genetic and/or hormonal causes. It is frequent in adolescents and young people under 30 years old, and usually related with the occurrence of acne.
                </p>
                <li id="head">Combination</li>
                <p id="p1">Based on its location, it presents characteristics of both dry and oily skin since the distribution of sebaceous and sweat glands is not homogeneous. The area with more oil is usually the T- zone (forehead, nose, and chin), while the skin on the cheeks is normal or dry.
